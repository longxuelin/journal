4. Usage Tutorial - Technical Document Registration Log (related to test.py)

```bash
After opening the test.py file, there will be a Russian - language interface. The specific function is to upload technical documents.
Specifically, the filling of the document name, developer, approver, number of pages, storage location, registration date, approval date, and remarks is required.
An error will be reported when parts such as the developer and approver are not filled in.
